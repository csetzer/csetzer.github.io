In this article proof theoretically strong extensions of Martin-Loef Type Theory are presented, including the proof theoretically strongest published extension, the Mahlo universe, as developed by the author. For the first time a model for this theory and some weaker universe constructions is given. Together with a previously published lower bound for the strength of this type theory, the precise proof theoretic strength of the Mahlo universe is determined. This is fundamental work in determining proof theoretically strong constructive theories which have the same strength as theories used in classical mathematics as part of a revised Hilbert program.
