Title: Object-oriented programming in dependent type theory
   Abstract:
       In previous work we have introduced the notion of objects in dependent type theory
       and carried out a case study. In this talk we will introduce some more advanced 
       features such as server side programming, and how this is used to develop 
       graphical user interfaces. We will discuss as well first steps towards obtaining
       full object-orientation programming, especially first steps towards adding a heap.
