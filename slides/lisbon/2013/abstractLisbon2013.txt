Coinduction, corecursion, copatterns

Thibodeau (Montreal) )


In computer science, most computations are in fact interactive
programs, which correspond to computations which can potentially
run forever. They can be represented as trees which
have potentially infinite branches. Mathematically, these
data types are coalgebraic data types.

Coalgebraic data types are often represented in functional
programming as codata types.
Implicit in formulations of codata types is that codata
types fulfil bisimulation equality, which is undecidable.
This resulted in lack of subject reduction in the
theorem prover Coq and a formulation of coalgebraic types
in Agda, which is severely restricted.

In this talk we demonstrate how, when using the fact that
coalgebras are the dual of algebras we obtain a formulation
of coalgebras which is completely symmetrical to that
of algebras. Introduction rules for algebras are
given by the constructors, whereas elimination rules
correspond to recursive termination checked pattern matching.
Elimination rules for coalgebras are given by destructors,
whereas introduction rules are given by recursive
termination checked copattern matching. 

The resulting theory fulfils subject reduction is conjectured
to be normalising.
