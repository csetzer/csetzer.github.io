Extraction of programs from proofs using postulated axioms
  (Anton Setzer, joint work with Chi Ming Chuang)

In this talk we discuss how to extract programs from 
proofs with postulated axioms in dependent type theory.
Since type theory has constructive logic, it is easy
to determine for every $\Pi_2$-statement a function
$f$ which determines the witness from the input.
However, in the presence of postulated axioms, this
function applied to an argument
doesn't reduce necessarily to constructor head normal
form, which means it doesn't produce a value.

In this talk we discuss conditions which guarantee
that the extracted function provide values in the presence of
postulated axioms, and give a proof.

This methodology will be applied to the extraction 
of alogrithms for exact real number computations. 
For this purpose the signed digit reals are introduced
as a coalgebraic data type, and it is shown that the signed digit
reals are closed under average, multiplication
and rational numbers. Proofs have been carried
out in the theorem prover Agda and the resulting
programs can be executed effectively in this 
language.
