Induction-Recursion - 20 years later


In  this talk  we first  start  to review  the prehistory  of
induction-recursion,   starting  with   the   Backhouse  1988
"Do-it-yourself-type-theory", Peter Dybjer's 1989/90 schemata
for inductive definitions,  and Thierry Coquand and Christine
Paulin's  inductively defined  types.  These development  led
then to the May 1992 Munich talk and the June 1992 TYPES talk
in which a general schema for inductive-recursive definitions
was introduced.  We consider the TLCA paper by Dybjer and the
author,    in    which    a    closed    axiomatisation    of
induction-recursion was  presented, and its  reformulation in
the   APAL  paper  on   initial  algebras.    We  investigate
applications to generic programming.   Then we look at recent
developments,  the   formulation  of  induction-induction  by
Fredrik   Forsberg  and   the  author,   and   a  categorical
reformulation  of induction-recursion by  Neil Ghani  et al.,
which  generalises  induction-recursion   to  a  much  larger
variety of situations.  Finally we discuss open problems such
as  how to extend  induction recursion  to include  the Mahlo
principle and what  a notion of coinduction-corecursion could
be.
