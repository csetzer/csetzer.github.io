Title: The extended predicative Mahlo Universe and the need for partial proofs and 
       partial objects in type theory.
Joint work with Reinhard Kahle, Lisbon
 
The Mahlo Universe in Martin-LÃ¶f Type Theory has an introduction rule which refers
to all total functions from families of sets of the Mahlo universe into itself.
This makes it an impredicative definition. Although it can be justified by the fact
that no elimination rules are added, a more predicative justification is desirable.

We have defined the extended predicative Mahlo universe in the area of Explicit
Mathematics in which we weaken the requirement for adding a subuniverse: instead
of demanding closure of the Mahlo universe, all we need is that the subuniverse
is closed under a given function. For this to work we need
access to the collection of all partial functions, which is not available in type theory.

As a consequence, in this system partial functions are necessary, which will then as well
be part of proof objects, so we obtain partial proofs. 
We will discuss steps towards developing a new type theory in which one has access to
the collection of all partial functions.
