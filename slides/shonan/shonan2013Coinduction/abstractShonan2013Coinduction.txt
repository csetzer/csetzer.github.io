Continuing the talk by Andreas Abel on nested (co)pattern matching 

* We show how to unnest nested (co)pattern matching, reduce it to (co)recursion operators, and, in the case it is supposed to pass a termination nchecker, primitive (co)recursion.

* We show a small theorem, that type checking on coalgebras is undecidable, even if we assume
the simple property that two streams are equal if their heads and tails are equal.
