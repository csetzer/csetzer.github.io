I have now successfully installed a test application with mime type  zzz for extension *.zzz:

The following will probably work system wide if one replaces
~/.local/share/    by /usr/share/

Steps
1) in    ~/.local/share/mime/packages/
     createa a an xml file similar to the ones in the directory xmlFiles/d (same as in my previous mail)
    
2) in ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list
add an entry 
 which associate the application/mimetype   with a desktop entry
3) Create a desktop entry in
~/.local/share/applications/
like the one we had before.
4) run 
update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/

In my case it worked for an extension .zzz using the files
in the directory
filesForInstallationZZZ/
When running dolphin and clicking on a file with extension .zzz should
open a shell and the command ~/bin/test is executed
