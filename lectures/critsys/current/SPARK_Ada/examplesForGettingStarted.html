    <h1>SPARK Ada Examples for Getting Started (includes example similar to coursework)</h1>

<h2> Example for getting started with Question 1 of coursework 1</h2>
<ul>
<li> Good example for getting started with Question 1 of coursework 1
is the clock example.
<ul>
  <li> located in the git respository at<br>
~/git/criticalhighintegritysystems/examplesForCoursework/conversion24hrClock12hrAMPMClock/<br>
 <a href="https://bitbucket.org/anton_setzer/criticalhighintegritysystems/src/master/examplesForCoursework/conversion24hrClock12hrAMPMClock/">Link to git repository</a><br>

    <ul>
    <li> This directory contains several versions corresponding to different
         stages in answering your coursework question.
    <li> You can read the README.txt file located there for basic instructions.
    <li> It is best to study with a simple example, which forms
a template for question 1 (a)
      <ul>
	<li> The example is <br>
~/git/criticalhighintegritysystems/examplesForCoursework/conversion24hrClock12hrAMPMClock/withoutIO/vers01OnlyAdaWithIntegers/<br>
    This example contains a simple program. It doesn't have 
(as all files in the subdirectory "withoutIO") a main file, so you can 
compile it but you don't obtain an executable file<br>
This allows you to focus on a simple package.
        <li> As always you should make a copy of that directory and work on that
copy.
	<li> For the coursework 1 (a) you can comment out the 
definition of the function function, since 
we will create a function only later, once we have introduced a record
type.
<li> You cannot execute the code but check that it is syntactically correct 
by compiling it using<br>
gnatstudio &rarr; Build &rarr; Project &rarr; Build All
<li> Now you can adapt it to a solution for Question 1 (a).
</ul>
<Li> The second example includes an executable file and is a template
for Question 1 (b).
<ul>
<li> The example is <br>
~/git/criticalhighintegritysystems/examplesForCoursework/conversion24hrClock12hrAMPMClock/withIO/vers02OnlyAdaWithIOIntegersNoLibrary/<br>
   <li> It contains a main.adb file, which is the executable file
   <li> This file you can compile (make sure main.adb is selected) by executing
Build &rarr; Project &rarr; Build &lt; current file &gt; <br>
   <li> You can run it as described in <a href="basicUsageOfGnatStudio.html">Basic Usage of gnatstudio</a> by executing<br>
    Build &rarr; Run &rarr; Custom<br>
    Click on both "Run in executables directory" and "Run in an external terminal". 
   <li> A terminal opens. In that opened terminal type in<br>
./main<br>
("main" is the executable file, and "./" makes sure that you execute the 
one in your current directory)
   <li> If nothing happens you may need to follow the 
<a href="settingUpMachineForSparkAdaForUsageFromFileManager.html">instructions
for setting up Spark Ada for Usage from File Manger</a> and
change preferences so that instead of "xterm -hold -e" you get
the command "xterm -hold".
   <li> If everything was correct  the main program of the clock example
should start.
   <li> This example can be used as a template for answering question 1 (b)
</ul>

<li> For later parts of question 1, you can use further versions of the clock example
as a template.
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<h2> Further examples for getting started</h2>

<ul>
<li> Examples using IO can be found in <a href="examplesIO.html">examplesIO</a>
<li> <a href="exampleCodeForTesting.html">Complete example with some guidance on how to use SPARK Ada</a>
(this is the example recommended in the 
<a href="settingUpMachineForSparkAdaForUsageFromFileManagerUsingScript.html">Instructions for setting up SPARK Ada using file manager</a>)

<li>Another example is <br>
sparkAdaCodeLecture/sect3c/example3c-14
</br>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/anton_setzer/criticalhighintegritysystems/src/master/sparkAdaCodeLecture/sect3c/example3c-14/">link to git repository</a>
<br>
This is an example which will give an error message when running flow
analysis, so it demonstrates how SPRAK Ada reports error. You can then
go through and modify it.
