    <h1>Basic Linux Terminlogy</h1>

<ul>
<li> By "Directory" under Linux we mean what is called under 
Windows  "Folder".<br>
However sometimes in Linux Distributions the word "Folder" is used as well.
<li> The home directory (called in the File manager "Home") is in Linux
denoted by "~".
<li> Subdirectories are separated in Linux by backslash "/".<br>
For instance "~/bin" is the subdirectory bin of ~ where ~ denotes Home<br>
So its from the file manager reached by using Home -> bin
</ul>
