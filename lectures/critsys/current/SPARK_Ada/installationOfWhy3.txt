For viewing and proving verification conditions I found it easier
to install why3 directly and run why3 on the generated .mlw files
(which are in a directory gnatprove).

Installation of  why3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Install as well maybe first altergo (used by sparkada) and other
theorem provers, see 
https://www.lri.fr/~marche/MPRI-2-36-1/install.html
on how to install these together with why3

It is recommended to first install the theorem prover
Coq 
http://coq.inria.fr/
(Under linux this might be part of the packages available)

You need as well to install Ocaml
https://ocaml.org/
(Under linux this might be part of the packages available)


Download code from  http://why3.lri.fr/

Follow instructions  in 
http://why3.lri.fr/doc-0.81/manual006.html

Essentially carry out 
./configure

Check what wasn't installed.
If you want additional features, install them first
(under linux most packages should be available from your distribution)

possibly do again
./configure until everything you need is installed.

Then run
make
make install


If when executing 
why3
you get the Spark Ada installation, you need to adapt your path
so that the path to Spark Ada (under linux usually /usr/gnat/bin/) 
occurs at the end of your path.

Follow
https://www.lri.fr/~marche/MPRI-2-36-1/install.html
regarding installation of additional theorem provers.

Run
why3 config --detect-provers
to activate provers.

In my case I got lots of files from /usr/gnat/* which were part of
the SparkAda installation, which then let to incompatibilities
I went to the file 
~/.why3.conf
and replaced those files by the corresponding files in 
/usr/local/share/why3/
/usr/local/lib/why3/

I actually found it easier to maintain my local version of the configuration
file, by making a copy of 
~/.why3.conf in ~/.why3.myversion.conf

I needed as well some ml2 libraries from the sparkAda libraray
which were located in 
/usr/gnat/share/spark/theories/

Therefore I executed why3 using the command

why3 ide -C ~/.why3.myversion.conf -L /usr/gnat/share/spark/theories <file.mlw>
(with <file.mlw> replaced by the file to be used.
