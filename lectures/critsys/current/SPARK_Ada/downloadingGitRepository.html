    <h1>Downloading Examples from Lecture CSCM13/CSC313</h1>

<ul>
<li> It is good practice to put git repositories in a common directory for
git repostories such as ~/git.
<li> It is best not to modify the code in the git repository unless you want
to contribute to the development of this repository.
<ul>
<li> Instead you make a copy of the code.
<li> Otherwise, you will loose the possibilty of updating the repository
by using "git  pull"
</ul>
<li> The optimal way is to  clone the git repository
<ul>
<li> On Linux machines you can install git (installed in the Linux Lab
and in many Linux distributions).
<li> On other machines there are various tools for dealing with git repositories,
but ideally you use one which comes with a shell (sometimes called "powershell").
</ul>
<li> To clone the git repository go to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/anton_setzer/criticalhighintegritysystems/src/master/">git repository</a>
<ul>
<li> Go to the clone button on the top right corder and
choose the https version.
<li> In a terminal move to where the git repository should be created
copy the command and press return.
</ul>
<li> Alternatively you can download it from the <br>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/anton_setzer/criticalhighintegritysystems/downloads/">Download page for the
git repository for CSCM13/CSC313</a> as a zip file<br>
<ul>
<li> Click on "Download repository"
<li> Please note, you would need to download new copies when updates are
available.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2> Interpreting Paths in the git repository</h2>

<ul>
<li> When referring to for instance <br>
<br>
sparkAdaCodeLecture/sect6/example6-20-wrapperClassForIOWithoutExample/<br>
<br>
or shorter<br>
<br>
sect6/example6-20-wrapperClassForIOWithoutExample/<br>
<br>
we mean the files you get by navigating<br>
home directory -&gt; git -&gt; criticalhighintegritysystems -&gt;
sparkAdaCodeLecture -&gt; sect6 -&gt; example6-20-wrapperClassForIOWithoutExample
</ul>
