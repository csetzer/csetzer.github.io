    <h1>Recommended Usage of SPARK Ada</h1>

<ul>
<li> For terminology such as directory, ~/bin etc see 
the short file <a href="basicTerminologyInLinux.html">Basic Terminology
in Linux</a>
<li> See <a href="basicUsageOfSparkAda.html">basic usage of SPARK Ada</a>
for basic usage instructions.
<li> It is recommended that for small projects you 
<ul>
<li> have all files 
(file.ads and file.adb) belonging to it in one directory, 
<li> add the file <a href="../files/lib/main.gpr">main.gpr</a> to it
</ul>
<li> SPARK Ada will generate some files automatically, especially
there will  be a subdirectory <strong>gnatprove</strong>.
<li> When you open with gps the main.gpr file provided, 
all ads and adb files in the
directory where the main.gpr file is located will belong to the current
SPARK Ada and nothing else 
<ul>
<li> Especially no files in any subdirectories will be added.
</ul>
<li> It is recommended that when opening gps to open a terminal,
navigate using the command<br>
<br>
cd dirname<br> 
<br> 
for changing the directory to dirname<br> 
and <br>
<br>
cd ..<br>
<br>
for moving up one level in the directory hierarchy<br>
until you have reached the directory with a project containing your
file main.gpr.<br>
Then start gps on main.gpr using<br>
<br>
gps main.gpr &<br>
<br>
<li> Please open any files associated with your project using the side menu,
and not using the file manu from the top. <br>
There is a file icon in the side menu
with a "." (which refers to the home directory of the 
project) and if you click on it you can access the files in the current directory.
<li> If you open files directly from the file menu, and they are not in the
same directory as your gps file, then these files will not be checked
using SPARK Ada, since
SPARK Ada will only check files associated with your current gpr file.
<li> Note that <strong>file names</strong> need to be in 
<strong>lower case</strong> and should <strong>not start with a digit</strong>
otherwise gps will <strong>ignore those file</strong>.
<li> Before deleting/renaming/editing files without using gps it is best
to close down gps first and then reopen it again. Otherwise you get
<strong>synchronisation problems</strong> with gps. 
<li> For creating a new project the best is to create a new directory,
and copy from an existing example (for instance the 
<a href="examplesFromLecture/examplesFromLectureInstructions.html">ada examples from
the lecture</a>) the ads and adb fiels to your directory, possibly rename them,
and then edit them to suit your needs. 
</ul>
