    <h1>Lab Sessions Critical Systems CSCM13/High Integrity Systems CSC313</h1>

<h2> Quick Start Guide for Windows Machines</h2>
<ul>
<li> Follow instructions on Canvas for
installing SPARK Ada on your own machine and accessing 
SPARK Ada on Swanse University computers.
<li> Then follow the 
<a href="downloadingGitRepository.html">Instructions for
Downloading the Git Repository for CSC313/CSCM13</a>
(this may have happened already if you followed the  Video guide)
<li> Test your setup by using  the exampleCodeForTesting
the installation found in the git repository
your installation


<li> Study <a href="basicUsageOfSparkAda.html">Basic Usage Instructions for SPARK Ada</a>
<li> Check out <a href="guideToExamples.html">SPARK Ada code examples (including <font color="red"><strong>Examples from the lectures and other sources</strong></font>)</a>  <br>
Especially we recommmend to study the 
"Examples for Getting Started".<br>
The example<br>
examplesForCoursework/conversion24hrClock12hrAMPMClock<br> 
can be used as a good starting point for 
answering Question 1 of the coursework
<li> The lab sheet and the coursework can be found under Canvas.
<li> On Canvas you can find as well a useful cheat sheet for SPARK Ada.
</ul>
<h2>Instructions for Linux Machines</h2>
<ul>
<li> Start by following the <a href="settingUpMachineForSparkAdaForUsageFromFileManager.html">Instructions 
so that you can use SPARK Ada and why3 from the File Manager</a>
<li> Copy the folders
<ul>
<li> ~/git/criticalhighintegritysystems/exampleCodeForTesting/
<li> ~/git/criticalhighintegritysystems/sparkAdaCodeLecture/
</ul>
to a location where you want to work with
<ul>
<li> Reason is: Git repository updates frequently
<li> If you work on it, updating of git repository failes due to conflict.
<li> Should you ever get problems, move<br>
~/git/criticalhighintegritysystems<br>
to a new destination and set up git repository again
following <a href="downloadingGitRepository.html">Instructions for downloading
Git repository with SPARK Ada code examples</a> 
</ul>
<li><a href="basicLinuxInstructions.html">Some basic instructions about using
Linux and Emacs can be found here</a>
<li> <a href="settingUpMachineForSparkAda.html">Instructions for setting up
machines in the Linux Lab for using SPARK Ada and why3 from command line</a>
</ul>

<h2> More extensive instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li> Test your setup by using <a href="exampleCodeForTesting.html">Example code for testing
your installation</a>
<li> Check out <a href="guideToExamples.html">SPARK Ada code examples (including <font color="red"><strong>Examples from the lectures and other sources</strong></font>)</a>  The git repository should be uploaded to your computer already.
<li> <a href="basicUsageOfSparkAda.html">Basic Usage Instructions for SPARK Ada</a>
<li> The lab sheet and the coursework can be found under Canvas.
<li> It is recommended to first investigate one or more 
<a href="guideToExamples.html">examples
of SPARK Ada from the lecture</a> and experiment with them.
<li> You might try out as well the

<li> SPARK Ada can easily be installed under Linux, Windows, and Mac OS,
and probably some other operating systems,

<li> Obsolete 2020/21 since why3 not used in labs
<ul>
<li> Advantage of Linux is that it allows to
install  the why3 system 
(which is helpful but not always necessary)
<li>When we have reached verification conditions in the module,
