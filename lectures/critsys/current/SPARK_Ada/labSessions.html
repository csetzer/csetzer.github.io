    <h1>Lab Sessions Critical Systems CSCM13/High Integrity Systems CSC313</h1>

<h2>Instructions for Linux Machines</h2>
<ul>
<li> Download the git responsiory as described in 
<a href="downloadingGitRepository.html">instructions
for downloading the gt Repository for CSC313/CSCM13</a>
<li> Now we want to explore some examples.
<ul>
<li> It is important to leave the git repository untouched. Then
you can update it by running<br>
git pull<br>
rather than having to download the whole repository again and again.
</ul>
<li> We first work on the example code for testing the installation.
<ul>
<li>It is located at<br>
~/git/criticalhighintegritysystems/exampleCodeForTesting/<br>
This code is mainly used to check whether everything is set up correctly<br>
<li> Copy that folder to a location in your file system where you want to 
work on it (outside the git repository)
<li> Now you can follow the <a href="settingUpMachineForSparkAdaForUsageFromFileManager.html">Instructions 
so that you can use SPARK Ada (and why3) from the File Manager</a>
<li> Once you have done so, study <a href="basicUsageOfSparkAda.html">basic usage instructions of SPARK Ada</a>
<li> Now you can look at <a href="examplesForGettingStarted.html">Examples for getting started</a>
<li> Check out <a href="guideToExamples.html">SPARK Ada code examples (including <font color="red"><strong>Examples from the lectures and other sources</strong></font>)</a>  <br>
<li> The lab sheet and the coursework can be found under Canvas.

<h2> Quick Start Guide for Windows Machines</h2>
<ul>
<li> Follow instructions on Canvas for
installing SPARK Ada on your own machine and accessing 
SPARK Ada on Swanse University computers.
<li> Then follow the 
<a href="downloadingGitRepository.html">Instructions for
Downloading the Git Repository for CSC313/CSCM13</a>
(this may have happened already if you followed the  Video guide)
<li> Test your setup by using  the exampleCodeForTesting
the installation found in the git repository
your installation
<li> Once you have done so, study <a href="basicUsageOfSparkAda.html">basic usage instructions of SPARK Ada</a>
<li> Now you can look at <a href="examplesForGettingStarted.html">Examples for getting started</a>
<li> Check out <a href="guideToExamples.html">SPARK Ada code examples (including <font color="red"><strong>Examples from the lectures and other sources</strong></font>)</a>  <br>

<li> The lab sheet and the coursework can be found under Canvas.
<li> It is recommended to first investigate one or more 
<a href="guideToExamples.html">examples
of SPARK Ada from the lecture</a> and experiment with them.
