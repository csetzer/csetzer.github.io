    <h1>Example Code for Testing Installation of Spark Ada</h1>

On Linux Machines in the Linux Lab, please follow 
<a href="testingInstallationLinuxLab.html">Testing Installation of SPARK Ada on Linux Machines in the Linux Lab</a>


<h2> Preliminaries</h2>
<ul>
<li> In the following we use the Linux terminology 
"directory" for what is called in Windows 
"folder".
</li><li> The example code for testing SPARK Ada is an adaption of the code from the lecture sect6/example6-19.
</li><li> Download the git repository following the <a href="http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/~csetzer/lectures/critsys/current/SPARK_Ada/downloadingGitRepository.html">instructions
for downloading the git repository</a> 
</li><li> The example code for testing can be found in the subdirectory
<strong>exampleCodeForTestingInstallations</strong>
</li></ul>



<h2> Trying out gnatstudio</h2> 

<ul>
<li> You can start gnatstudio directly as an application.
<ul>
<li> Then you can open from the starting menu or
file menu  SPARK Ada project
file main.gpr located in the directory
exampleCodeForTestingInstallations.<br>
This file may be called something like GNAT project file.
</li></ul>
</li><li> You can as well associate gnatstudio as default application for 
files with extension gpr, so that it will be opened from 
SPARK Ada project files.<br>
This might be already the case if you have
installed SPARK Ada yourself on a Windows computer.
<ul>
<li> In this case you can start gnatstudio directly from the
main.gpr file in the directory
exampleCodeForTestingInstallations (called "project file" in windows)
</li></ul>
</li><li> Opening gnatstudio  might take a while initially because it initialises some data.
</li><li> It should look approximately like the following
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/anton_setzer/criticalhighintegritysystems/src/master/screenshots/gnatStudioScreenshot.png">Screenshot</a>
</li><li> There should be a menu item SPARK on the top.
If you don't have this item, you have only installed 
Ada but not SPARK Ada.
</li><li> If you execute SPARK &rarr; Examine all,  you should see
at the buttom a script running which should check your code
successfully, provided you have the correct version of SPARK
Ada installed.
</li></ul>
