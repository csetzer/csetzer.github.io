Go to
https://www.adacore.com/download

Download and install from there the latest version
  (if your operating system is not listed go to
   More packages, platforms, versions and sources 
   at the bottom of the page)

Unpack the installed files.

In the diretory you can find a README files giving instructions on how to 
in stall it.

For viewing and proving verification conditions I found it easier
to install why3 directly and run why3 on the generated .mlw files
(which are in a directory gnatprove).
See the file installationOfSparkAda2014.txt 


Running
~~~~~~~~~
Just execute gps which will start a GUI for SPARK Ada

Documentation about Spark Ada
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
in the installation in 
  /usr/gnat/share/doc/

As well online:

Getting started:
http://docs.adacore.com/spark2014-docs/html/ug/getting_started.html

Refrence manual

Usage of Ada
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Graphical user interface from Spark Ada:
execute gps

From commandline:
gnatmake file




Usage of Spark Ada
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Graphical user interface
execute
gps
(you might need to adjust your path)

From commandline
gnatprove -P main.gpr  --proof=progressive

where the simplest version of main.gpr  is
project Main is
   package Compiler is
      for Default_Switches ("ada") use ("-gnatwa");
   end Compiler;
end Main;


You can use as well a mainWithoutRangeCheck.gpr file  instead of main.gpr
  - SPARK Ada will NOT create
   verification conditions referring to range conditions when this file is used.
