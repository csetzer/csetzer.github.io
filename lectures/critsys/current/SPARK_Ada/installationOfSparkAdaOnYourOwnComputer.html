    <h1>Installation of SPARK Ada on Your Own Computer</h1>

<ul>
<Li> For Windows Machines see instructions on Canvas.
<li> For access to Linux machines you may 
Consider as well <a href="remoteAccessToLinuxLab.html">remote access to
the Linux Lab</a>
<li> There exist a free version of SPARK Ada, which can be installed under Linux, Windows, Mac 
(you can even install some components under LEGO mindstorms, Raspberry Pi,
  AVR, and more).
<ul>
<li> SPARK Ada is available from <a href="https://www.adacore.com/download">Ada Core Libre</a> 
<li> We are using in the Linux Lab the latest version (2021).
<li> The coursework needs to compile and be checked with the 2021 version.
<ul>
<li> If there is no menu for choosing a platform and version go to end
where  says "More packages, platforms, versions and sources".
</ul>
<li> Installation is relatively easy, just follow the instructions
in the README.txt file.
<li> Follow the <a href="exampleCodeForTesting.html">Instructions
for testing SPARK Ada Installation</a>
</ul>
<li><a href="https://www.adacore.com/academia/">Academic version of SPARK Ada</a> 
(needs registration, for academics only; apparently the code is the same as the GPL
version, but there is additional support).
<li> Why3 will probably NOT be required for lab tasks in the labs 2022/23,
but we might demonstrate its usage during the labs.
<ul>
<li> You will not obtain the GUI of the why3 system  from SPARK Ada
<ul>
<li> The only instructions for installing why3 we are aware of are for Linux, 
although we have managed with some effort
to install it on macs  
<li> See some rudimentary <a href="installationOfWhy3.txt">Instructions how to install Why3</a><br>
<li> Why3 is used only occasionally to display verification conditions,
most work is done using SPARK Ada.
<li> Therefore the recommendation is to not install it on your own
computer and use the lab for this.
<li> Since installation is complex Anton Setzer will not 
help you with installation of why3 - use the machines in the 
Linux Lab for why3.
</ul>
</ul>
<li> Some older instructions (referring to 2014 version) can be found
