<li> Note that there is no computer support available Friday late afternoon - Monday morning.
<li> From Linux Machines you can get remote login to any other linux machine by using the command<br>
<br>
ssh -X username@machineaddress<br>
<br>
<li> The user name is your login name.
<li> The machine address should be<br>  
<br>
machinename.swan.ac.uk <br>
<br>
where machinename is the machine name of a machine in the linux machine (displayed at login).
<li> Note that if too many students access the same machine it might get overloaded. So it is good to use different machines
