    <h1>Testing Installation of SPARK Ada (GPS) on Linux Machines in the Linux Lab</h1>

<h2> Preliminaries</h2>
<ul>
<li> In the following we use the Linux terminology 
"directory" for what is called in Windows 
"folder".
<li> The example code for testing SPARK Ada is an adaption of the code from the lecture sect6/example6-19.
<li> Download the git repository following the <a href="../downloadingGitRepository.html">instructions
for downloading the git repository</a> 
<li> The example code for testing can be found in the subdirectory
<strong>exampleCodeForTestingInstallations</strong>
</ul>


<h2> Testing Installation of SPARK Ada (gps)</h2> 
<ul>
<li> Now open the file browser (dolphin) which is on the start menu.
<li> Navigate to exampleCodeForTestingInstallations
<li> If you click on the file main.gpr  (NOT main.adb or main.ads) gps should start.<br>
This might take a while initially because it initialises some data when used the first time.
<li> It should look approximately like the following
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/anton_setzer/criticalhighintegritysystems/src/master/screenshots/GPSscreenshot.png">Screenshot</a>
<li> If it opens instead in an editor (usually kate) you need to manually associate the filextension with the application
<ul>
<li> Right click on main.gpr, choose "open with"
<li> Search for callgps
<li> Don't tick "open with Konsole"
<li> Tick to remember the selection.
<li> Do the same below in section "Testing installtion of why3"
for a file with extension .mlw, associate it with 
"callwhy3".
</ul>
<li> Should starting of gps fail, gps might not be installed on your machine.
<ul>
<li> If in Linux Lab, tell instructors about which machine has
the problem (need to look at the machine name on a konsole prompt)
so that system adminstrators
can  fix it later.
<li> Go to a different machine.
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<li> If you haven't installed SPARK Ada and Why3 using script (e.g. on your own computer), you can 
<ul>
<li> Either  manually associate the extension .gpr with the command callgps and the extension
.mlw with the command callwhy3
<li> or start those commands from a console, calling<br>
callgps  main.gpr<br>
or<br>
callwhy3  file.mlw<br>
where file.mlw is a mlw file you want to see in why3.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2> Basic Usage of GPS</h2> 
See <a href="basicUsageOfGnatStudio.html">Basic Usage of GPS</a>


<h2> Testing Installation of Why3 (Optional)</h2> 
<ul>
<li> Because of Online Usage during Covid-19 and the 
Why3 system not being available on Windows machine,
the lab for CSCM13/CSC313 will not make use of the why3
system, so setting up the why3 system is optional.

<li> Navigate (in dolphin) to the subdirectory gnatprove
<li> Click on the file main.mlw
<li> why3 should start. 
<ul>
<li> If it doesn't start why3 might not be installed.
<li> If in Linux Lab, tell instructors about which machine has
the problem (need to look at the machine name on a konsole prompt)
so that system adminstrators
can  fix it later.
<li> Go to a different machine.
</ul>
<li> Currently why3 will display an error message as in this
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/anton_setzer/criticalhighintegritysystems/src/master/screenshots/errorWhy3.png">Screenshot</a>. 
<ul>
<li>You can ignore this message (which is due to different libraries used by
SPARK Ada and why3).
<li> Please press the "close" button.
</ul>
<li>The main window  should look approximately look like the following
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/anton_setzer/criticalhighintegritysystems/src/master/screenshots/why3screenshot.png">Screenshot</a>.
<li> Close why3, we won't need it at the moment. We only tried it out to test the installation.
</ul>
