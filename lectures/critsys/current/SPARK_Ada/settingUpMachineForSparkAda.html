    <h1>Setting up Linux Machines in Linux Lab at Swansea University for Spark Ada Using Shell</h1>

<ul>
<li> The following is if you want to use Spark Ada from the command line.
<li> In the following by "Directory" I mean what is sometimes called "Folder".<br>
<li> By "command shell" I mean in  the following "Konsole" or "terminal".
<li> If you are not using the machines in the Linux lab
you may need to add a line with the path to the gnat installation
to your file ~/.bashrc (in the home directory)<br>
<br>
export PATH=/usr/local/gnat/bin/:$PATH<br>
<br>
where the path (here /usr/local/gnat/bin/ ) is shown during installation of
gnatstudio.
The easiest way to cut and paste the two lines below starting with "echo ' " 
and ending with  "bashrc" in one go into a command shell.<br> 
Then press return<br>
<br>
echo '<br>
export PATH=/usr/local/gnat/bin/:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc<br>
<br>
<li> Open a new command shell. Now if you execute<br>
<br>
echo $PATH<br>
<br>
you should get a sequence of paths (separated by :) starting with<br>
<br>
/usr/local/gnat/bin/:<br>
<br>
For instance (depending on your installation) it could like this:<br>
<br>
/usr/local/gnat/bin/:/usr/lib64/mpi/gcc/openmpi/bin:/home/staff/cssetzer/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/X11R6/bin
<br>
<br>
<li> In order to activate the why3 system (likely not necessary 2022/23) you need to do the same steps as 
above, but with path /usr/bin/<br>
So in more details this is done as follows:
<ul>
<li> You need to add the following line to your file ~/.bashrc (in the home directory)<br>
<br>
export PATH=/usr/bin/:$PATH<br>
<br>
The easiest way to cut and paste the two lines below starting with "echo ' " 
and ending with  "bashrc" in one go into a command shell.<br> 
Then press return<br>
<br>
echo '<br>
export PATH=/usr/bin/:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc<br>
<br>
<li> Open a new command shell. Now if you execute<br>
<br>
echo $PATH<br>
<br>
you should get a sequence of paths (separated by :) starting with<br>
<br>
/usr/local/bin/:<br>
<br>
For instance (depending on your installation) it could like this:<br>
<br>
/usr/local/bin/:/usr/local/gnat/bin/:/usr/lib64/mpi/gcc/openmpi/bin:/home/staff/cssetzer/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/X11R6/bin
<br>
<br>
<br>

</ul>
</ul>
